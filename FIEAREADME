This project was made for my Systems Software class. We worked in a team of 3
to create this compiler. We each worked on the virtual machine separately, so
runVM is my own code. We collaborated to some extent on the runScanner code,
but the bulk of the code was written by myself also. The runParser involved
much more collaboration, and most of my contribution to that section was
adding the code generating lines. "in.txt" and "input.txt" are provided
as sample programs.
